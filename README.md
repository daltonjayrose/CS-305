# CS-305

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**  
Artemis Financial is a financial company looking to audit and improve the security of their software.  
  
**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**  
I think I did a good job of analyzing the security risks present in the client's software and identifying solutions to address those risks. Software security is very important because software vulnerabilities could result in the loss of assets, sensitive data, or even life. Failing to implement proper software security practices is an enermous risk for a company to take.   
  
**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**  
I would say the most difficult part in the vulnerability assessment was the amount of research needed. Research was required to learn more about each of the vulnerabilities detected in the dependency check report and also to determine which encryption algorithms would be best suited for the project. This project has taught me a lot about best practices in software security. 
  
**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**  
In this project, I increased layers of security by implementing TLS, encryption, and certificate authentication. I also utilized the dependency checker tool to check for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies. In the future, many of the same techniques and methods would likely be used. However, some choices may be slightly different depending on the needs of the application.
  
**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**  
After refactoring the code, I ran the dependency checker tool again to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I also conducted manual review of my code and testing of the application to ensure everything functioned correctly. However, this does not entirely eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities in my code.
  
**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**  
In this project, I learned more about a wide variety of topics: encryption, hashing, certificate authentication, and more. Gaining experience with these concepts and implementations will be very helpful in future assignments or projects. This course also introduced me to OWASP which will be a valuable resource for software security. 
  
**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**  
With this assignment, I hope to show future employers that I have an understanding of software security and experience working with and implementing software security concepts.
